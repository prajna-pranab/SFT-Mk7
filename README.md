Mk6 was a nice looking design but the 3D printer I have use of is uncalibrated and is running a cut-down! version 1.0 of Marlin, so is not capable of printing gears to the tolerance needed to get gears to mesh well. Also the geometry was not good: the rotor was too small and hence the magnets were too close to the rotor axle, to which they were attracted.

This version is fully adjustable, has a larger rotor and better layout and uses a chain drive to synchronise the magnets. There will be a pause until I can build and test it because the design calls for some SKF 635 bearings and will have to wait on delivery.
